                    <p class="lead">I have a degre in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Tech, and have almost 10 years of work history working in the mechanical and manufacturing engineering field. I was interested in software from high school, when I took a class on Visual Basic, which taught me the basic of conditional statements and loops. Afterward I became more interested in it during college, when I took two computer science classes, using the programming language MatLab, which stands for Matrix Laboratory. One of the cool thing about MatLab is that using this program, I could generate 2D and 3D charts, and also could manipulate matrices, for instance I could rotate an image at any angle, which is essentially a matrix of pixels. I decided to go with Mechanical Engineering because I was also passionate about physics and math, and believed Mechanical Engineering to be the best avenue to pursue my passions in a practical manner. Over the course of my work career mostly as a manufacturing engineer, I used a variety of 2D and 3D CAD software for drawing and designing structural components, and I spent a lot of time troubleshooting those software, which sparked my renewed interest in computer programming. Additionally I was informed by friends, relatives, and colleagues, who are in the software industry, about how challenging, rewarding, and logically driven, the role of a developer and computer programmer can be. Also I realized that the parallel and overlap between the general engineering field and software field is strong, as they both involve problem solving and analytical thinking. So I decided to pursue a career change into the software tech industry.

                        I recently took an part-time online course on core Java, which taught me the basic of object-oriented programming in general and Java programming in particular. I learned about classes, interfaces, and many other essential building blocks of Java. After that brief course, I wanted to learn more about Java, and especially how to put it to practical use. So I took a career break from my engineering job and enrolled into a full-time 16 week coding boot camp at DevMountain. I just finished the first 8 weeks of the boot camp, which is the foundation portion. During foundation, students at DevMountain are introduced to the basic of software developing and full-stack web building. The skills acquired during this time is described in the skills section of my portfolio. Starting from 9th week, I will start the specialization portion, specializing and focusing exclusively on Java software engineering.

                        <p>I had a lot of fun during my work for the capstone project for the foundation portion of DevMountain coding boot camp. For my project, I learned a very cool functionality of javascript for applying animation to wegpages, which uses a recursive loop with a controllable time delay between each iteration of the loop. I learned to retrieve and control CSS properties of HTML elements in an object oriented manner, and I created classes of HTML elements and created objects from those classes for assigning to those objects methods and attributes. Essentially the end result of the project was a game of soccer ball shooting, where user of the website can control speed and angle of the ball, and can shoot the ball to a goal which is changing location randomly with each score, and avoiding a moving goalkeeper which moves faster and faster as score increases, but reaches a terminal velocity for a specific value of the score. Score incremented by one point or four points, depending how the ball was shot toward the goal. I stored, retrieved, and updated key variables in the back end and communicated with back end using axios. I paid close attention to and optimally configured all the small and sometimes overlooked aspects of all the features, logic, and functionalities, covering all the edge cases, so that no matter what the user did, the game would progress in a satisfactory and consistent manner. </p>

                    <p class="lead">During the first 8 weeks here at DevMountain, I learned a lot about Javascript, HTML, CSS, SQL, manual testing, automation testing using Selenium, front-end, back-end, database, MongoDB, Express, Axios, how to deploy websites using Heroku, Windows terminal commands, and more. It has been a fun and rigorous time during these 8 weeks, where I learned a lot, worked in pair programming with my classmates, became highly confident in the frameworks and languages I mentioned above, especially Javascript, SQL, HTML, and CSS. I utilized these technologies to build my full-stack capstone project at the end of those 8 weeks. My project is explained more in the portfolio section.
